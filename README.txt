How to set up your mod:
>Go to the location of your Quake 4 game file in your system. If you are using Steam, the location of the file will likely be similar to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4
>Open the file "gameMod" here. 

Preparing the mod:
>Once the mod file has been opened and placed in the proper place, right click the Quake shortcut on your desktop.
>Out of the list of options that will be shown to you, select "Properties."
>Once you are in the Quake4.exe shortcut properties, go to the "Target" section. Here you will see "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4\Quake4.exe".
>At the end of this, type +disconnect+set fs_game gameMod
>+disconnect will cause Quake 4 to skip over the opening scene. +fs_game gameMod will cause Quake 4 to load the mod file upon startup.
